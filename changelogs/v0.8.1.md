Beta-8.1 brings the ability to set response headers from Wasm Runnables.

Using Rust, `resp::set_header(key, val)` will indicate to the caller that the module wants to set a Response header and the headers will be included in the job response.

This functionality only works when a CoordinatedRequest is mounted on the instance (by passing its JSON as the job data)
