## Improved WASI support, Redis cache, and more!

Beta-12 of Reactr brings some improvements and some new abilities:
- Improved compatibility with standard WASI modules by calling the standard `_start` function to initialize the module (the now-deprecated `init` is still called if `_start` is not present).
- Added support for Redis as a cache backend for the cache capability. Use `CacheConfig` when creating the Reactr instance to configure the Redis connection, and it will be used for all Wasm Runnables.
- Added the ability to autoscale the work threads used to handle Reactr jobs. This makes Reactr much more flexible when working with large spikes in traffic.
- Updated the internal Wasm runtime to latest avaialble.
