Welcome to Beta-8 of Reactr!

**This release is a breaking change for Rust Runnables**

Rust Runnables can now return errors! The signature of `run` has been changed to return `Result<Vec<u8>, RunErr>`, which allows propogating an error code and message to the caller. Consumers of Reactr can use `errors.As` to see if an error returned from a job is `rt.RunErr`, indicating that it was an error returned from a Runnable. Other error types indicate a failure to actually execute the Runnable in some way.

The Swift Runnable API will be updated in a future version to support returning errors.
