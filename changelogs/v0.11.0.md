## GraphQL support, auth provider, and more!

Beta-11 of Reactr brings some awesome new capabilities for Wasm Runnables. There is a new GraphQL capability, allowing Wasm modules to query GraphQL endpoints, and a new `AuthProvider` capability that allows the Reactr host to add authorization headers to outgoing HTTP/GraphQL calls in order to make applications more secure and flexible.

This release is the foudnation for Atmo Beta-3, which is coming soon and will include documentation for the new GraphQL API.
