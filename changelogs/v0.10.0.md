### AssemblyScript / TypeScript support is here!

Welcome to Beta-10, this release contains support for AssemblyScript! It's been a while in the making (mostly due to lack of time to work on it), but it's finally here! A few notes about the release:
	- There is a breaking change; `rt.Handle` has been renamed to `rt.Register`
	- AssemblyScript doesn't currently support setting response headers, accessing static files, or returning errors. Those will come soon.

You can use `subo` to create and build AS runnables as of version 0.0.16 with `subo create runnable awesomesauce --lang assemblyscript` (`typescript` works also). This release will be the basis for Atmo v0.2.3, and it will also support AS/TS.
