This release contains a huge internal improvement to how WebAssembly modules communicate with Reactr. There is no change needed to your code, but your Runnables will need to be re-compiled with the 0.9.0 libraries for Rust and Swift.

WebAssembly Runnables are now more performant when accessing or returning large amounts of data, and the new internal system will make it easier to develop new features in the future.

Of note, two pieces of functionality are still missing from the Swift library compared to Rust:
- Setting HTTP request and response headers
- Ability to return errors from the run method

These will be added soon.
